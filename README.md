# Credit Card Checker

This project uses JavaScript to check credit card numbers, create an array of invalid numbers from an array of number arrays, and identifies the companies who sourced those invalid credit card numbers. 

# Motivation

This project was completed as part of the Codecademy Back-End Developer certification program. The goal was to practice JavaScript functions, including more complicated mathematical functions including the Luhn algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm#Description) to verify credit card number validity. 

# Installation and Tests

To install, use, and test the functions:

* Download the folders and files onto your computer. 
* Uncomment the function calls at the bottom of the file
* From the command line, run "node main.js" 
* Examine the output for verification
